# Hearing Test Convertor
## Aardvark Initiative

### Project Description
The cochlear implant industry is facing a major challenge given multiple and incompatible measures from different types of hearing tests offered in different audiologist clinics. Using a large database from a local clinic, the application develops a linear regression formula between three different tests (AzBio, BKB, CNC).
